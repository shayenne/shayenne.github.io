## Biography

I am a master student at University of Sao Paulo/Brazil. I finished my  bachelor in Computer Science in 2016. Now, I am part of Computer Music Research Group at IME/USP and work with Music Information Retrieval tasks and other computer music related subjects.

I made a reseach in [Sensorial Consonance and Dissonance](github.com/shayenne/SensorialDissonance). My graduate work was about [Melody Accompaniment Separation](github.com/shayenne/MAS) and I had published the results on 16th Brazilian Simposium on Computer Music, 2017.

My recents interests are concerned on Machine Learning for Musical Information Retrieval, including Deep Neural Networks and its applications on Musical Tasks.
