What's up?

## 29.10.2018 Test tools

I started using igt-test-tools


## 26.10.2018 Pacthset review

Unfortunately, I did not send good modifications for the drivers. 

Two observations:
 - drm uses uint32_t as default in the definitions
 - change bool to unsigned int with bitfield could be not eficient, it depends on the struct and variables around it

I sent a new patchset with style cleanups fo drm/qxl.



## 24.10.2018 Patchset with cleanups

I sent a patchset with two patchs of style corrections. 



## 23.10.2018 First patch review

I received my first patch review. The kernel community is very active and answer fast the patches.  


## 22.10.2018 First patch sent

Today, I edited and compiled code to verify if it is working correctly.
Then, I sent my first patch! :D


## 19.10.2018 Outreachy first patch

Today I started my first patch setup for Outreachy program. I am now a Newbie! =) 

To start my way, I followed this tutorial: https://kernelnewbies.org/OutreachyIntro


## 15.10.2018 First installation of Arch Linux

Yesterday I began my exploration into Linux Kernel. My first task was install a virtualisation tool: Qemu. Then, I create a image for Arch Linux.

I followed these tutorials:

- Intall Qemu and start the image for Arch Linux: https://oslongjourney.github.io/linux-kernel/use-qemu-to-play-with-linux/ 
- Arch Linux Instalation: https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/
- SSH configuration: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Shell

I do not want to work inside the Qemu, so I defined my root to be accessible by ssh. Since my machine is only for tests, it is not a problem.

One very important tip: _MAKE A BACKUP!_ 

I already did mine! And now I am looking forward to start learning about how to compile and modify Linux Kernel!
