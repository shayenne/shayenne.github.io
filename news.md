## First installation of Arch Linux

Yesterday I began my exploration into Linux Kernel. My first task was install a virtualisation tool: Qemu. Then, I create a image for Arch Linux.

I followed these tutorials:

- Intall Qemu and start the image for Arch Linux: https://oslongjourney.github.io/linux-kernel/use-qemu-to-play-with-linux/ 
- Arch Linux Instalation: https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/
- SSH configuration: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Secure_Shell

I do not want to work inside the Qemu, so I defined my root to be accessible by ssh. Since my machine is only for tests, it is not a problem.

One very important tip: _MAKE A BACKUP!_ 

I already did mine! And now I am looking forward to start learning about how to compile and modify Linux Kernel!
